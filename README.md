# aws-s3-static-site-lab
âœ… AWS Lab: Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3 with IAM Permissions In this lab, I created an S3 bucket, enabled static website hosting, uploaded a custom index.html file, and configured a public read-only bucket policy. I also created an IAM user with limited S3 access and validated permissions using the AWS CLI.
