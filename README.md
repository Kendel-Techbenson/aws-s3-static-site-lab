# AWS S3 Static Website Hosting Lab

## üìÑ Summary
This project demonstrates how to host a static website using Amazon S3. The lab walks through creating a bucket, configuring it for static hosting, uploading a sample HTML file, managing permissions with IAM, and verifying access control using read-only roles.

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Did (Step-by-Step)

1. **Created an S3 Bucket**
2. **Enabled Static Website Hosting**
3. **Uploaded `index.html` to the bucket**
4. **Set a Bucket Policy for Public Access**
5. **Verified the Website was Live**
6. **Simulated Upload Denied using IAM ReadOnlyUser**
7. **Updated IAM Group Permissions to Allow Upload**
8. **Verified Upload Succeeds with Correct Policy**
9. **Created IAM Group and User with Read-Only Permissions**
10. **Tested Access and Verified Results**
